this is for installing project:
npx create-expo-app --template blank goal-app
cd my-app
npm run android

In this we cant work with html element because mobile phone which not have DOM
ex:
div->View
input->TextInput
button -> <Button title='Tap me'/> is a self clossig and title is a name
input ->TextInput
onClick->onPress
onChange->onChangeText
